Metallic Testing of Specimens lab report

# Abstract
Tensile and hardness testing of annealed, quenched, and quenched and tempered A2 tool steel were performed for the purpose of
material property characterization. The material properties of interest include: ultimate stress, yield stress, modulus of elasticity,
and Vickers hardness. These characteristics can bring insight into the strength, stiffness, and hardness of the steel. The MTS

servohydraulic system induced tension in each specimen, and recorded the axial force applied over time, as well as
the axial displacement of an attached extensometer until failure. Discernible material properties were observed for each sample
size of the three heat-treated specimens. Hardness testing data showed a positive correlation between hardness and strength. The
Leco LM800 microhardness tester was used to perform Vickers hardness testing. Understanding how material properties change
with heat treatment is important for meeting engineering design criteria.
